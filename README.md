This mod reworks fishing mechanics, adding new biome-specific fish to catch, a new fishing rod that can have bait attached, and a fishing minigame!

## Installation

Always a Bigger Fish is a client and server mod for Fabric 1.21.5. Its dependencies are listed below.

#### Dependencies
- [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) is required.
- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) is recommended to configure the mod.
- [Compost](https://modrinth.com/mod/compost) is recommended.

## Features

- To successfully fish a fish, you must complete a brief minigame (not yet implemented).
- The fish you catch are determined by where in the world you're fishing from. To make this system more varied, the mod adds over 20 extra fish items for you to fish up.
- To make caught fish more unique, they'll be assigned a random size. Boasting about big fish is encouraged and part of the intended experience.
- This mod introduces a new fishing rod, the Copper Rod, which can have bait attached in the inventory like a Bundle! Bait can be used to increase the speed you catch fish.

## Mod Compatibility

- Fishing information has been added to [Extended Item View](https://modrinth.com/mod/eiv) and [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) on NeoForge.
- This mod replaces vanilla's fishing loot tables with its own. Where possible, modded fish have been added to this mod's item tags, which makes them fishable with our biome fishing system. The following mods are currently supported.
  - Aquaculture 2
  - Upgrade Aquatic
