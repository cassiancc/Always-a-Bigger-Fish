This mod reworks fishing mechanics, adding new biome-specific fish to catch, a new fishing rod that can have bait attached, and a fishing minigame!

## Installation

Always a Bigger Fish is a client and server mod for Fabric 1.21.5. Its dependencies are listed below.

#### Dependencies
- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) is recommended to configure the mod.
- [Compost](https://modrinth.com/mod/compost) is recommended.

## Features

- To successfully fish a fish, you must complete a brief minigame (not yet implemented).
- The fish you catch are determined by where in the world you're fishing from and the bait attached to your rod. To make this system more varied, the mod adds over 75 extra fish items for you to fish up.
  - Biomes have been broken down into various categories based on their temperatures and the type of water. The temperature categories are Cold, Temperate, and Hot, and the water types are Saltwater, Freshwater, and Brackish. For more information on what fish are caught where, check [Extended Item View](https://modrinth.com/mod/eiv)!
  - Fishing below Y-32 also has unique results, fish caught there are depth dwelling Cave Fish! 
  - This mod adds three types of bait. The better the bait you put on your rod, the rarer fish you catch!
- To make caught fish more unique, they'll be assigned a random size. Boasting about big fish is encouraged and part of the intended experience.
- This mod introduces two new fishing rods - the Copper Rod, which can have bait attached in the inventory like a Bundle, and the Netherite Rod, which works like a Copper Rod, but can fish in Lava!

## Mod Compatibility

- Fishing information has been added to [Extended Item View](https://modrinth.com/mod/eiv), a 1.21.5 focused item viewer. Partial support exists for [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) and [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) on NeoForge.
- This mod replaces vanilla's fishing loot tables with its own. Where possible, modded fish have been added to this mod's item tags, which makes them fishable with our revamped fishing system. The following mods are currently supported.
  - Aquaculture 2
  - Upgrade Aquatic
